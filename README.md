# PLANT PROJECT

# WHAT
Full stack application to keep track of my plants at home! Includes information about plant such as height, location, image, and facts. Able to both add and delete plants as wanted.

# WHY
Part of the requirements for my Dev Academy Aotearoa bootcamp. Needed to use react and typescript and be deployed. It has now expanded into a personal project to develop and maintain my full-stack CRUD website development knowledge I learnt in my bootcamp - CRUD and RESTful websites as well as authentication, testing, and user experience.
